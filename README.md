A message broadcasting fun project. It uses node.js and socket.io to broadcast a message to everyone who has opened up a browser instance.

The server does not serve the UI, UI has to deployed separately, server just opens up a socket and accepts and broadcasts a message, all the messages are stored in a text file.
